    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular kind of machine learning model with the capacity to generate information is known as a generative model. There are many variations, but all they focus on learning patterns in a dataset to then produce data with a given seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, I will use a very simple generative probabilistic model called n-gram to generate midi sequences of music.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov Chain\n",
    "A Markov chain is a model that predicts the next event in a sequence based only on the present event, \"forgetting\" all the previous states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-gram Model\n",
    "An N-gram model is a probabilistic generative model which predicts the next sample in a sequence based on the previous n-1 samples. formaly\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_i | x_{i-(n-1)}, ..., x_{i-1})$$\n",

    "# Implementation\n",
    "In my implementation of the model (in this case a for n=3, also known as trigram), the basic idea is to create prefixes and suffixes. Notice that I don't have an exception for the case that the suffix is already in the dictionary for a given key (prefix). I insert it multiple times on purpose, this the most straightforward way of achieving the probabilistic feature of the model. In the end, this dictionary of the prefixes with all the suffixes will be our trained model. The decision of use as corpus a list of strings is due to the ease to manipulate them and use them as key in dictionaries."

The starting point is the mono-MusicXML-dataset (https://github.com/EelcovdW/mono-MusicXML-dataset), this consists of 3 lists of keys (train, evaluation and validation) for monophonic songs in musescore, a repository for music sheet.\n",

Then, I applied a series of cleaning and transformations to obtain an X and a Y array composed entirely by the integers representing the midi notes, focusing only in the sequence of notes and ignoring all the other features (time, tempo, etc.). The X corresponds to all the songs concatenated without the last element of each song, the Y to the same, but without the first note of each song, this can be used for an X -> Y type machine learning model.\n",

To have more data, I applied a strategy of data augmentation, this usually done in computer vision, to generate a more significant dataset of images by rotating and translating the existent one. In this case, I transposed each song to have a version of it with each possible note as key note depending on how far is the song from central C and trying to spread the song the best possible through the midi range (0-127).
